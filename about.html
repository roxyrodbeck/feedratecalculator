        <p>I created this web application to solve a problem I noticed over multiple hospital visits. </p>
        
        <p>Due to Sebastian's medical complexities (VACTERL Association), he was diagnosed with "failure to thrive," and a <a href="">gastronomy tube</a> was recommended 
        so he could receive tube feeds at night in order to gain more weight.</p>
        <p>During one of his many hospitalizations of 2022 and 2023, my husband and I often had to assist the night staff with Sebastian's gtube
        feeds. There were often "too many cooks in the kitchen." For example, the dietician would make a recommendation regarding 
        Sebastian's feed rate (ml/hour), but as his parents, we are aware that we either needed to skip his feeds when he is under the weather or 
        run them very slowly. On top of that, Sebastian also eats breakfast and dinner, so the time constraints often threw a wrench 
        into the plan as well.</p>
        <p>Since creating this web app, I have shared it with the tubie communities on Facebook and they have been <a href="">extremely supportive.</a></p>
        <p>The Tube Feed Rate Calculator is a work in progress, but it has motivated me to continue building solutions through web development.</p>
